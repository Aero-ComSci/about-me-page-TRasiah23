            <hr>
            <p> Hello fellow reader, if you scroll past this, we will detect you and your account will be deleted! First
                off
                all, my name is Travyn Rasiah and I'm a 9th grader going to a new school called Emerald High which is
                located in
                CA. I also wanted to inform you that my career goal is to get Straight A's throughout high school.
            <p>The way I'll be accomplishing this goal is by taking internships and jobs to boost my resume along with
                extracirriculars such as basketball in which I'm already Team Captain, head of a club, or join a club. I
                also aim
                for this goal by hustling and getting work done along with improvement and taking a lot of classes to
                keep
                me
                entertained because I often get bored. My inspiration is my parents as they always want what is best for
                me
                and
                for me to achieve whatever I want. </p>
            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <hr>
            All in all, I'm ready for highschool for the next 4 years to have a good future which I hope lies for me later in life. My commitment and ambition to anything is what make stand out from other kids and why I strive for greatness. Thank you for reading my resume and about me and I hope you enjoyed it a lot. Have a amazing day!
